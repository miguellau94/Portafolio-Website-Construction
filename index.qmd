I am an entrepreneur and business owner. I specialize in building community-centered experiences and leading operations that turn vision into reality. Through hands-on management, strategic marketing, and a passion for service, I’ve grown a specialty coffee shop into more than just a place to grab a drink—it's a welcoming space where people connect, relax, and feel cared for.

## About Me

Hi, I’m the proud co-owner of Margin Cafe Coffee Roasters, where I combine my love for coffee, community, and entrepreneurship. With a strong focus on quality and customer experience, I’ve built a space where people can enjoy great coffee and feel genuinely welcome.

I hold a degree in Business Administration and Marketing Management from Cal Poly Pomona, which has equipped me with the skills to grow and lead a successful business—from strategy and operations to branding and customer engagement.

Outside of running my business, I’m passionate about cars, road trips, and exploring nature—whether that means winding drives through scenic routes or discovering a hidden hiking trail. These experiences fuel my creativity and give me a fresh perspective to bring back to the café.

At my core, I’m someone who cares deeply about people. Whether it's crafting the perfect cup of coffee, offering a warm conversation, or leading a team, I find purpose in creating environments where others feel supported, seen, and taken care of.
