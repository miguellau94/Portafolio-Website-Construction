Below are selected projects that highlight my experience applying marketing analytics to the day-to-day and strategic operations of a specialty coffee shop. These examples demonstrate how I use data-driven insights to improve customer engagement, optimize promotional efforts, and grow the business.

From tracking in-store promotions to analyzing social media performance and customer behavior, each project reflects my ability to turn real-world marketing data into actionable strategies that enhance both brand presence and profitability.

## What Youâ€™ll Find

- **Campaign Performance Analysis:** Measuring the impact of seasonal promotions, local ads, and social media campaigns on foot traffic and sales.
- **Data Visualization:** Building intuitive dashboards to monitor daily performance metrics, customer trends, and marketing ROI.
- **Channel & Offer Attribution:** Identifying which marketing channels (e.g., Instagram, Google Maps, email) and offers are driving the most customer engagement and repeat visits.
- **Customer & Market Insights:** Using POS data, survey feedback, and web analytics to better understand buying habits, peak times, and menu preferences.
